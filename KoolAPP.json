If a solid is somewhat soft then it is pressed, you can make it change shape by pushing its atoms into new orientation. with liquids, the atoms are randomly arranged further apart. The forces between them are weaker and they can move about and flow past one another easily. Which makes them easy to pour. Gases have more randomly arranged atoms than either liquids or solids. The forces between the atoms are weak, so the atoms can move around freely because of its energy. A solid cannot be compressed because the particles are side by side. When a solid is heated its volume will expand as the temperature rises. Liquids take the shape of the container that it is in. When a liquid is heated its volume changes with temperature. A liquid cannot be compressed because the particles are close together. A gas will occupy the whole volume of its container. A as is easily compressed.

		"DEFINITION": "A biome is a big geographical region where certain types of plants and animals live. Each biome has a different set of environmental conditions and plants and animals that have adapted to those conditions. The major land biomes have names like tropical rain forest, grasslands, desert, temperate deciduous forest, taiga and tundra. Climate is the characteristic condition of the atmosphere in relation to the earthâ€™s surface at a certain place on earth. It is the long-term weather of that area. This includes the regionâ€™s pattern of weather characteristics, seasons and weather extremes like hurricanes, droughts, or rainy periods. The most important factors determining an areaâ€™s climate are air temperature and precipitation.",
		"EVERYDAYUSE": "How It Works: World biomes are created by climate. The climate of a region will dictate what plants will grow there, and what animals will live there. Three components, climate, plants and animals are combined to make a biome.",
		"HOWITWORKS": "There are three basic types of climates: Low-latitude Climates: These climates are controlled by equatorial a tropical air masses. Mid-latitude Climates: Climates in this zone are affected by air-masses. The tropical air-masses are blowing towards the poles and the polar air-masses are blowing towards the equator. These two air masses are always in conflict. Either air mass may control the area, but neither has more control. High-latitude climates: Polar and arctic air masses fill these regions. Canada and Siberia are two air-mass sources that are in this group"

		"EVERYDAYUSE": "Importance: Different kinds of matter can come together to form substances that may not look like any of the original ingredients. For example, hydrogen (a gaseous element) and oxygen (another gaseous element) come together to form Water {a liquid compound at room temperature}. When these elements combine, it is called a chemical reaction. A chemical reaction takes place between the electrons of the atoms, but does not affect the nuclei of the atoms.",
		"HOWITWORKS": "How It Works: All the states depend upon' the distance away from each molecule / atoms present in the material. Atoms are closest when matter is in solid state, however in state of gas, atoms are further from each other as s e in liquids and solids. Changing temperature like heating can also change the state of the matter. Sometimes elements change their states due to heat and pressure. Water can move in phases so can change to ice when freezing, and also ice can change back to water through heating because evaporation"
