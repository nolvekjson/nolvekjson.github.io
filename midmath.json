	"DEFINITION": "An acronym for the words parenthesis, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction. Given two or more operations in a single expression, the order of the letters in PEMDAS tells you what to calculate first, second, third and so on, until the calculation is complete. If there are grouping symbols in the expression, PEMDAS tells you to calculate within the grouping symbols firs",
	"EVERYDAYUSE": "Problem solving with equations",
	"HOWITWORKS": "Calculate 36 - 2(20 + 12 / 4 * 3 - 2^2) + 10. Since there is a grouping symbol, I must perform all calculations in the parenthesis first, using PEMDAS for any operations in that expression."

	"EVERYDAYUSE": "A power is another mathematics term for exponent. For example 5 to the third power is expressed as 53; where the 3 is the exponent. When you see a problem like this, you multiply the larger number by itself, as many times as the number of the exponent or power indicates. For example; 53= 5x5x5=125 35= 3x3x3x3x3=243.",
